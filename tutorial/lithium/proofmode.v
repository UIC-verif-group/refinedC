(** The argument [efoc] can be used to specify the construct that should be
reduced. For example, you can write [wp_pure (EIf _ _ _)], which will search
for an [EIf _ _ _] in the expression, and reduce it.

The use of [open_constr] in this tactic is essential. It will convert all holes
(i.e. [_]s) into evars, that later get unified when an occurences is found
(see [unify e' efoc] in the code below). *)

We achieve this by putting [AsRecV_recv] in the current environment so that it
can be used as an instance by the typeclass resolution system. We then perform
the reduction, and finally we clear this new hypothesis. *)
